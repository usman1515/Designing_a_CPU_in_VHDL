## 1.   Introduction

This repository serves as a learning point aimed at diving into the world of VHDL programming and FPGA implementation. As someone familiar with Verilog, I started this project to explore VHDL and its application in hardware design.

The primary objective of this project is to design a CPU utilizing [VHDL](https://resources.pcb.cadence.com/blog/2020-hardware-description-languages-vhdl-vs-verilog-and-their-functional-uses), employing the [Basys3](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/start) board as the target platform and leveraging [Xilinx Vivado 2021.2](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools.html) for creating the project.

Through this project, I aim to expand my knowledge and skills in VHDL programming and FPGA development.
